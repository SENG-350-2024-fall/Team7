# Getting started with this code
First you will need to run `npm install` to install all of the needed node modules.
Next you will have to run the `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000` command to start the jason database server.
Finally, in a different terminal you will run `npm run start` to run the program locally.
You should have two terminals running. One for the jason server, and one for the web application.
