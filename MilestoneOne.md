We split our Use Case Diagram into five smaller diagrams based on each use case's primary actor, as seen in the following sections.

The Mister Ed system is a medical information system that enhances resources for emergency departments (EDs). Its purpose is to reduce time spent in crowded wait rooms and improve the efficiency of patient flow. Its main feature is virtual triage which allows users to assess their symptoms and receive recommendations. The virtual triage feature in Mister Ed provides recommendations which could include visiting a clinic, self-care instructions, or waiting at home until it’s time for an ED visit. The patient will see recommendations made by the app if their symptoms are common enough that the app is able to make a suggestion, otherwise, medical staff will be prompted to provide a recommendation. Based on the provided recommendation the patient can determine whether they should visit an ED or use alternate treatment methods. This helps reduce unnecessary ED visits, taking the load off hospitals. <br>

The system also allows patients and call center staff to view the ED waitlist which provides real-time information on the capacity of local hospitals. This feature helps patients decide the best time and place to seek care while distributing patient loads across multiple locations. The system provides capacity percentages and expected wait time based on emergency severity. This information can be used by patients to determine which ED to join a waitlist for and by call center staff to determine when to call a wait-listed patient to start travelling. Once a patient has received a recommendation from the virtual triage they can choose to join the waitlist for an ED, this allows a patient to wait their turn from the comfort of their own home. Being able to wait from home will reduce the amount of people in the ED and save patients the frustration of having to sit in a waiting room for hours. The call center will then notify patients when to proceed to the hospital.<br>

In addition to these features, Mister Ed facilitates patient registration for the ED, reducing administrative tasks when patients arrive. The system integrates with the ED database, ensuring patient data is shared with healthcare providers. By connecting patients, medical staff, and emergency departments through virtual triage Mister Ed optimizes the use of healthcare resources, improves the overall patient experience, and reduces the load on medical staff.<br>

| **Assumptions**             | - The system accurately assesses the ED load and provides a reasonable waiting time.  |
| **Steps**                   | 1. The patient decides to enter an ED queue based on the system recommendation. <br> 2. The system assigns the patient a place in the queue and provides an estimated wait time. <br> 3. The patient waits at home and receives a notification when it is their turn to visit the ED. | 
| **Non-Functional** | **Accuracy**: The system must be accurate in estimating waiting times to avoid overcrowding at the ED. |
| **Issues**                | - How will ED wait times be affected by delays in the system notifying the patient late? |


<a name="medical-staff-use-cases"></a>
