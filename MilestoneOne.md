## Use Cases

<br>Patient Registration Use Case (Tay Munro):
| **Use Case**      | Patient Registration |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Description**   | This use case allows a patient to register virtually using the Mister Ed system. The system collects patient details, validates the input, and registers the patient into the emergency department queue.|
| **Actors**        | Patient, Mister Ed System, ED Staff |
| **Assumptions**   | The patient has internet access, the system is online, and the patient can enter correct information. |
| **Steps**         | 1. Patient accesses Mister Ed System.<br> 2. Patient provides personal details (name, age, symptoms, etc.).<br> 3. Mister Ed validates patient details.<br> 4. The patient is registered in the system |
| **Variations (Optional)** | 1. Patient already has an account and logs in instead of providing details.<br> 2. Patient chooses not to proceed after seeing the current ED load.<br> 3. System fails to validate patient details (e.g., incorrect or incomplete information). |
| **Non-Functional (Optional)** | 1. The system should handle at least 10,000 concurrent registrations without performance degradation.<br> 2. Registration should take less than 2 minutes per patient. |
| **Issues**        | 1. How to handle patients with limited internet access.<br> 2. Integrating with external triage systems.<br> 3. Data security and patient privacy concerns. |

<br>Provide Recommendation Use Case (Tristan Cornwell):
| Use Case                | Provide Recommendation                                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description             | System interprets the results of a patient's virtual triage and provides a recommendation to the patient on how to proceed with treatment. |
| Actors                  | MisterED System (primary), Patient |
| Assumptions             | Patient has filled in all required information in the registration and virtual triage.<br> Patient is logged in to the MisterED system. |
| Steps                   | 1. System notifies patient that it has received their information. <br> 2. System starts searching for a nearby ER. <br> 3. REPEAT <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1 System finds an ER within 40km of the patient's address. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2 System checks the estimated wait time for the ER. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNTIL there are no more ERs within 40km of the patient. <br> 4. System displays the given ERs and their corresponding wait times to the patient. <br> 4. Patient selects their desired ER. <br> 5. System places patient in the queue for the chosen ER |Â 
| Variations (Optional)   | 2. System suggests that the patient visit a primary care clinic **or** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System suggests that the patient take a particular over-the-counter medication **or** <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System suggests that the patient contact the nurse/clinician hotline over the phone or Internet and provides a phone number and URL. |
| Non-Functional (Optional) | Performance: time to find nearby ERs or provide an alternative recommendation must be less than 15 seconds. |
| Issues                  | What if there aren't any ERs close enough to the patient? |
